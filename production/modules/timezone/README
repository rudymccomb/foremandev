# Puppet Timezone Module #

A very basic Puppet module to set the timezone properly.  Works on
RHEL/CentOS, SUSE, Debian, Ubuntu and Gentoo.

Requires >= Puppet 3.2.0 on Debian and Ubuntu because of a Puppet bug
and the way timezone files have been laid out on disk.
Works with Puppet 2.7+ on other distros.

## Usage ##

In your manifest:

class { 'timezone':
  region   => 'Europe',
  locality => 'London',
}

Or you can simply include timezone and set the details via hiera:

timezone::region: Europe
timezone::locality: London
