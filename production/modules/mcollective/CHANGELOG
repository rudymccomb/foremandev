Summary:

This release adds `delete_guest_user` for RabbitMQ so that you don't have an

the middleware appropriately.  The README has been updated with further
information.

- Add $delete_guest_user functionality.
- Add middleware_admin_user and middleware_admin_password parameters.
- Don't supply a client.cfg when securityprovider is 'ssl'
